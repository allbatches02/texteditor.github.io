<p><strong>Edit Pad History</strong>:<br><br>
I created the original Edit Pad website and it went live in <a href="../external.html?link=https://web.archive.org/web/20070110034522/http://www.editpad.org/" title="EditPad on Archive.org">January, 2007</a>.
<br><br>
In early January, 2021, I then <a href="../external.html?link=https://sedo.com/search/details/?language=us&amp;aid=1798945" title="EditPad.org sold on Sedo.com">sold the domain name</a> on Sedo.com <a href="../external.html?link=https://domainnamewire.com/2021/01/21/end-user-domain-name-sales-up-to-60k/" title="EditPad.org sold without content">without the content or website</a>.
<br><br>
Because it's a website used daily by a lot of people (including myself!), I have simply switched the website to using a different domain. Please always access the EditPad website now using the OnlineTextEditor.com domain name. Different domain, same website! Also, please be sure to update your bookmarks and links.

<p>The <a href="../external.html?link=https://www.onlinetexteditor.com/" title="Edit Pad">Edit Pad</a> website is a free online text holder and simple online editor for plain text.</p>
<p>The coding of this website is intended to protect you from losing any text that you may be in the process of editing - even if you lose your internet connection or go offline in the middle of editing something.</p>
<p><strong>Privacy Policy</strong>:<br><br>
Unlike other online text editing services, we do <strong>NOT</strong> save any of your text on our web server. We offer no login mechanism and no mechanism for saving your text files on our servers and instead just provide a method for you to download and save text on <strong>your own computer</strong> via your web browser. Although we do use basic web statistics to find out how many people visit our site and where they come from, we in no way track or save the text that you edit on EditPad. We reserve the right to change this policy at some point in the future (ie: by adding a registration and login function that would enable you to save files online), but if we decide to pursue this we will first post such proposed changes to our privacy policy here in advance, and you will then be asked if you agree to this changed policy before participating in such a system.</p>
